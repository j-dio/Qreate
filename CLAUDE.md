## Project Overview

**Qreate** - Automated exam creator desktop application using AI to generate review exams from study materials.

**Current Status**: Production-ready with Groq AI backend, local PDF generation, and SQLite usage tracking.

**Supported Files**: .txt, .docx (PDF extraction disabled)
**User Quotas**: 10 exams/day, 100/month, 10-100 questions per exam

## Architecture

### Electron Multi-Process

- **Main Process** (`src/main/`): Node.js backend, databases, file operations, Groq AI
- **Renderer Process** (`src/renderer/`): React frontend with TypeScript
- **Preload Script** (`src/preload/`): Secure IPC bridge between main↔renderer

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19.2.0 + React Router + Tailwind CSS + Zustand stores
- **Backend**: Node.js + SQLite (better-sqlite3) + Groq SDK
- **File Processing**: mammoth (.docx), fs/promises (.txt)
- **PDF Generation**: Electron's built-in printToPDF()

### State Management (Zustand)

- **useAppStore**: Authentication, global settings
- **useFileUploadStore**: File upload workflow
- **useExamConfigStore**: Question types, difficulty distribution
- **useExamGenerationStore**: Generation progress, results

### Database Schema (SQLite)

```sql
users: id, email, password_hash, created_at
user_usage: user_id, exams_today, exams_this_month, resets
exams: id, user_id, title, topic, total_questions, file_path, created_at
```

## Implementation Patterns

### IPC Communication

```typescript
// Main: ipcMain.handle('groq-generate-exam', async (_, config, sourceText, userId) => ...)
// Renderer: await window.electron.groq.generateExam(config, text, 1)
```

### Key Services

- **GroqProvider**: AI exam generation with retry logic
- **DatabaseService**: SQLite operations with auto-schema
- **UsageTrackingService**: Quota enforcement and rate limiting
- **FileTextExtractor**: .txt/.docx text extraction

### Critical Notes

- Environment: `.env.local` contains GROQ_API_KEY (gitignored)
- Test user: Hardcoded user_id=1 for development
- Max exam size: 100 questions (reduced for reliability)
- No store persistence (resets on app restart by design)
- PDF files disabled (see BUG_REPORT_PDF_EXTRACTION.md)

## Critical Prompt Engineering

### Current Groq Backend Format

**Implementation:** Groq's `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` model (100% success rate, production-tested)

```
SYSTEM ROLE: You are an expert exam creator. Generate ONLY the exam content with no introductory text, explanations, or suggestions.

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
General Topic: [Auto-extracted from content]
----Exam Content----
[Questions organized by type and difficulty]
[PAGE BREAK]
----Answer Key----
[Answers only, on separate page]

USER REQUEST:
- Source Material: [File content]
- Question Types: [List with quantities]
- Difficulty: [Distribution breakdown]
- Total Items: [Number]

CRITICAL: Output ONLY exam content in the format above. No extra text.
```

**Configuration:** `maxTokens: 16384, temperature: 0.7` (tested 30-100 questions)

## Key Design Principles

### Foolproofing

- Clear validation at every step with inline error messages
- Disable "Next" button until valid configuration
- Auto-save and recovery mechanisms
- Transparent process with progress tracking
- No data loss - auto-save every action

### Error Handling

- Network issues: Auto-retry, save progress, show offline mode
- API failures: Queue requests, show service status
- User errors: Undo button, confirmation dialogs, input validation
- All errors show specific, actionable messages

### State Management

- Use XState for complex multi-step workflow
- Implement proper state machines for phase transitions
- Ensures resumability and error recovery

### Real-time Updates

- WebSockets for live progress tracking
- Show file processing status, exam generation progress
- Estimated time remaining

- Show recommended item counts per type
- Visual feedback for all long-running operations
- Tooltips and guided tutorials for first-time users
- In-app help and FAQ

## Success Criteria

- User never loses progress (auto-save and recovery)
- Clear validation at every step (no ambiguous errors)
- Guaranteed output format (strict prompt engineering)
- Handles all edge cases (file issues, API failures, network problems)
- User can always access past work (project history)
- Transparent process (progress tracking and status updates)
- Flexible download options (multiple formats)
- Easy to use (intuitive UI with helpful guidance)
- Recoverable from any failure (retry, resume, restore)

## Memory/Context Notes

### Project Initialization

- Repository initialized on 2025-10-26
- Initial flow documented in `c:\Users\John Dio Lumacang\Downloads\Tech Projects.pdf`
- Refined flow includes 6 major phases with comprehensive error handling
- MCP servers configured: context7, playwright, filesystem, sqlite, memory, fetch

### Project Goals & Philosophy

**CRITICAL: This app must be complete and production-ready for deployment.**

- **Efficiency**: Optimize for performance, minimize API calls, efficient file processing
- **Modularity**: Build reusable components, clear separation of concerns, easy to maintain
- **High Functionality**: Implement all features from the refined flow, robust error handling, excellent UX
- **Production Quality**:
  - Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E)
  - Proper error logging and monitoring
  - Security best practices
  - Professional UI/UX
  - Documentation for users and developers

### Development Approach

**Educational & Transparent**: The developer is learning alongside implementation.

For every implementation step, Claude should:

1. **Explain the "Why"**: Rationale behind architectural and technical decisions
2. **Explain the "What"**: What each piece of code/configuration does
3. **Explain the "How"**: How components interact and work together
4. **Show Alternatives**: Mention alternative approaches when relevant
5. **Best Practices**: Highlight industry best practices being applied
6. **Learning Resources**: Suggest docs or concepts to explore further

This is a learning journey - take time to understand each step before moving forward.

### Key Decisions

- **Desktop Framework**: Electron ✅
- **Backend**: Node.js + Fastify (TypeScript) ✅
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript ✅
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui (modern, customizable)
- **State Management**: Zustand (global) + XState (workflows) ✅
- **Database**: SQLite (better-sqlite3) ✅
- **API Layer**: tRPC (type-safe communication) ✅
- **Validation**: Zod ✅
- **Testing**: Vitest + Playwright ✅
- **Background Jobs**: BullMQ ✅
- Focus on foolproof UX with extensive validation and error recovery
- Project history stored locally in SQLite with optional cloud sync
- **Production-ready**: Every component should be deployment-quality, not MVP/prototype
- **Educational**: Deep explanations for learning, developer is new to React/TypeScript

## Multi-LLM Quality Analysis (November 2025)

### Critical Finding: Universal Quiz Generator

**IMPORTANT:** Qreate is **NOT specialized** for any specific subject or discipline. The goal is to generate quality quizzes for **ANY subject** - math, science, philosophy, history, literature, etc.

### Multi-LLM Review Results (7 AI Models)

**Test File:** `jam's-test8.docx` (Developmental Biology)  
**Generated:** 100-question exam via Groq backend  
**Reviewers:** Amazon Nova, Gemini, Mistral, Claude, Grok AI, Qwen, Deepseek

**Consensus Scores (Average):**

- **Quality:** 7.4/10
- **Accuracy:** 8.7/10
- **Clarity:** 7.7/10
- **Difficulty:** 7.1/10
- **Format:** 8.9/10
- **Coverage:** 8.1/10

### Universal Issues Identified

**1. Critical Factual Errors (All LLMs flagged):**

- Subject-specific errors (cytotrophoblast, neural crest derivatives)
- These patterns would appear in ANY subject (wrong formulas in math, incorrect dates in history, etc.)

**2. Question Repetition (Major):**

- ~40 unique concepts stretched to 100 questions
- Pattern: Questions 11-13 mirror 21-25, 14-18 repeat in 26-30
- **Universal problem:** Would occur in any subject matter

**3. Difficulty Issues (Universal):**

- 60% basic recall, only 10% application/analysis
- **Key insight:** Difficulty distribution is USER-CONTROLLED, not our responsibility
- Our job: Generate accurate difficulty levels that users request

### Subject-Agnostic Improvement Plan

**What Users Control:**

- Difficulty distribution (10 easy, 20 medium, 5 hard, etc.)
- Question types (Multiple choice, True/False, Essay, etc.)
- Total number of questions

**What We Must Fix (Universal):**

**1. Accuracy** - Answers must be correct based on source material (any subject)
**2. Uniqueness** - No repetitive/duplicate questions (any subject)
**3. Difficulty Accuracy** - Each question matches requested difficulty level
**4. Exam-like Feel** - Professional, realistic assessment experience

### Universal Prompt Engineering Strategy

```typescript
const universalPromptTemplate = `
You are an expert educator creating assessment questions from provided material.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. GENERATE UNIQUE QUESTIONS: No repetition or near-duplicates
2. VERIFY AGAINST SOURCE: Base all answers strictly on provided text only
3. DIFFICULTY ACCURACY: Match each question to requested difficulty level:
   - Very Easy: Basic recall of explicitly stated facts
   - Easy: Simple concept recognition and definitions
   - Moderate: Understanding relationships and applying concepts
   - Hard: Analysis, synthesis, and complex reasoning
   - Very Hard: Evaluation, creation, and advanced critical thinking
4. QUESTION VARIETY: Mix factual recall, conceptual understanding, and application

AVOID:
- Questions testing the same concept multiple times
- Answers not explicitly supported by source material
- Speculation beyond provided information

Generate exactly ${totalQuestions} questions covering the material comprehensively.
`
```

### Implementation Focus (Subject-Neutral)

**Phase 1: Core Quality Fixes**

- **Uniqueness detection:** Semantic similarity across any subject
- **Source fidelity:** Only use explicitly stated information
- **Difficulty mapping:** Accurate difficulty regardless of subject
- **Professional format:** Exam-quality presentation

**Phase 2: Universal Validation**

- **Deduplication algorithms:** Work across all disciplines
- **Answer verification:** Check against source text
- **Format standardization:** Professional appearance
- **Quality metrics:** Subject-agnostic scoring

**Phase 3: Enhanced Universal Features**

- **Smart question generation:** Detect key concepts automatically
- **Adaptive complexity:** Auto-adjust to source material level
- **Cross-subject validation:** Universal accuracy checking

### Key Insight

The **core issues** (repetition, accuracy, difficulty balance) are **universal problems** that apply to any subject. Biology-specific errors are just examples - similar patterns would appear in:

- **Math:** Wrong formulas, incorrect calculations
- **History:** Incorrect dates, misattributed events
- **Philosophy:** Misquoted philosophers, wrong attributions
- **Literature:** Incorrect plot details, wrong character attributions

**This is actually cleaner** - we build robust, subject-agnostic quality controls rather than domain-specific fixes.

**Goal:** Universal quiz generator that works excellently across all disciplines, creating realistic exam experiences for student review.
